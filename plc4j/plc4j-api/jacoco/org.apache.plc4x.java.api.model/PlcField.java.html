 * Base type for all field types.
 * Typically every driver provides an implementation of this interface in order
 * to be able to describe the fields of a resource. As this is completely tied to
 * the implemented protocol, this base interface makes absolutely no assumption to
 * any information it should provide.
 *
 * In order to stay platform and protocol independent every driver connection implementation
 * provides a prepareField(String) method that is able to parse a string representation of
 * a resource into it's individual field type. Manually constructing PlcField objects
 * manually makes the solution less independent from the protocol, but might be faster.

     * Returns the &quot;default&quot; type of the response one can expect from this field as java type.
     * I.e., a call to getXXX for the ResponseItem should succeed.
     *
     * The contract is not to return the exact type which is internally hold by PLC4X but to
     * return a &quot;casteable&quot; type, i.e., a type whiches getXXX method succeeds.
     * So for example if a type is internally a short, but the getInt() method is implemented, it
     * is allowed to return Integer.class by this method.
     *
     * &lt;b&gt;This method should always return the BOXED type for primitives. E.g. not bool.class but Boolean.class&lt;/b&gt;
     * @return Either specific type or Object.class if no specific type is known.
